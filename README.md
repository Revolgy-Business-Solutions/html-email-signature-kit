# HTML Email Signature Kit for Seamless Branding

This is a simple HTML email signature kit that you can use to create your own email signature.

## How to use

You can extract any part of this repository and use it in your own email signature. You can also use the whole template as a starting point.

### Structure

This repository contains the HTML tags in `tags` repository and email signature templates in `templates` repository.

### Tags

This repository contains a set of HTML tags in `tags` folder. You can use these tags to create your own email signature. These tags are designed to be used in a table layout which is supported by most email clients.

### Templates

#### HTML templates

If you want to use the whole template, you can use the HTML templates in `html-templates` folder. These templates are designed to be used in a table layout. You can use these templates as a starting point and customize them according to your needs.

For custom configurations, please:

- Replace `HREF` with your own links
- Replace `SRC` with your own image URLs
- Replace `ALT` with your own alt (description) text
- Replace `test@example.com` with your own email address
- Replace `123456789` with your own phone number
- Replace `https://example.com` with your own website
- Replace all the visible text with your own text

Or replace those with variables if you use some templating engine for example our [Free Signature Manager for Gmailâ„¢](https://www.revolgy.com/google-workspace/gmail-signature-manager).

#### Vue templates

Another repository, `templates`, contains some pre-designed email signatures that you can use as a starting point. Those templates are written in Vue, but you can easily convert them to HTML. To do so:

- Use only the content in `template` tag from the Vue file, not the `template` itself
- Remove `:` in front of `styles`, `width` and other attributes
- Remove `v-if`, `v-else-if` and `v-else` attributes completely
- Replace variables with your real values

We kept the Vue files in this repository to show which parts are dependent on each other. If you see same parts throughout the template, you know that you need to handle these parts together.

#### Assets.js

`assets.js` file contains assets used in the templates. You can use these assets in your own email signature. The most important part is FONT_FAMILY variable where you can see all the fonts used in the templates. Other variables are there just for the list.
